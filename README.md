# Clicker Application




## Introduction
The education is constantly evolving, and the instructors are looking for new methods of teaching. So, our need to make an interactive application became especially important to help the instructors to evolve the interaction in their lectures. 
## Project Overview
Clicker is a classroom interactive response system that allows students to participate in polls and answer questions during class. Students can respond with their mobile device using the Clicker app.  
 
Clicker allows the instructor to make public and private courses, and then creating diverse ways of pop exams, such as Multiple-Choice Questions, short answer, and poll exams during the lecture. After that, the quiz statistics will be shown on the instructor’s page. 
 
It is a new, easy, and faster way of learning. Using the application during the lecture makes it easier for different quizzes instead of planning for them and paper usage. One of the new features in this project, the instructor can take attendance with only on click.

## FAQ

#### What is the difference between Public and Private Courses?

Private course: A course that only the students of that class can be added and it is not open for everyone.
Public course: A course that is visible for everyone and they can join whenever they want.

#### Does this application has a future views?

Yes. We will try to implement it at the German Jordanian University, and connect it with the system to be as a substitution way of teaching.
And also we will try to make it a certified in the grades marking.
